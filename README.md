# DSA-for-Beginner
A Curated list of LeetCode problems, categorized by common data structures and concepts, that are good for Java beginners.

# I. Arrays

Arrays are fundamental. These problems will help you get comfortable with array manipulation, iterating, and basic search operations.


1. Two Sum (No. 1): A classic. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

2. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (No. 26): Practice in-place modification of arrays.

3. Remove Element (No. 27): Similar to the above, focuses on removing specific elements.

4. Plus One (No. 66): Deals with array manipulation and carrying over digits.

5. Merge Sorted Array (No. 88): In-place merging of two sorted arrays.

6. Contains Duplicate (No. 217): Introduces the idea of checking for duplicates, often solved efficiently with a HashSet.

7. Single Number (No. 136): A good introduction to bit manipulation or using a HashMap/HashSet.

8. Intersection of Two Arrays II (No. 350): Involves finding common elements, good for practicing HashMap or sorting.

9. Move Zeroes (No. 283): In-place array modification to move all zeros to the end.

# II. Strings

Strings are arrays of characters, so many array concepts apply. These problems often involve character manipulation, iteration, and basic string operations.

1. Reverse String (No. 344): Simple string reversal, good for two-pointer technique.

2. First Unique Character in a String (No. 387): Introduces character frequency counting, often using a HashMap or an array as a frequency map.

3. Valid Anagram (No. 242): Checking if two strings are anagrams of each other, often solved with character counts.

4. Longest Common Prefix (No. 14): Finding the longest common prefix among a list of strings.

5. Implement strStr() (No. 28): A basic string searching algorithm (similar to indexOf()).

# III. Hash Maps/Hash Sets

Hash maps (HashMap) and hash sets (HashSet) are incredibly useful for efficient lookups.

Two Sum (No. 1): (Reiterated, as it's a prime example of HashMap usage)

Contains Duplicate (No. 217): (Reiterated, as HashSet is an optimal solution)

Valid Anagram (No. 242): (Reiterated, for character counting with HashMap)

Happy Number (No. 202): Involves detecting cycles, which can be done with a HashSet.

# IV. Linked Lists

Linked lists are a different way to organize data. These problems introduce pointer manipulation.

Reverse Linked List (No. 206): A fundamental linked list problem.

Merge Two Sorted Lists (No. 21): Merging two sorted linked lists.

Linked List Cycle (No. 141): Detecting cycles in a linked list using the fast and slow pointer approach.
