# I. Arrays

Arrays are fundamental. These problems will help you get comfortable with array manipulation, iterating, and basic search operations.


Two Sum (No. 1): A classic. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (No. 26): Practice in-place modification of arrays.

Remove Element (No. 27): Similar to the above, focuses on removing specific elements.

Plus One (No. 66): Deals with array manipulation and carrying over digits.

Merge Sorted Array (No. 88): In-place merging of two sorted arrays.

Contains Duplicate (No. 217): Introduces the idea of checking for duplicates, often solved efficiently with a HashSet.

Single Number (No. 136): A good introduction to bit manipulation or using a HashMap/HashSet.

Intersection of Two Arrays II (No. 350): Involves finding common elements, good for practicing HashMap or sorting.

Move Zeroes (No. 283): In-place array modification to move all zeros to the end.
